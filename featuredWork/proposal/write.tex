\author{Daniel Ocampo\\ Henry Wang}
\maketitle

So we would do research on the stock market data. We want to collect Data from the stock market from the day before 2016 election until Thanksgiving. We hope we that data will be able to find trends to estimate the stock market in the future. While also seeing if stock market has plunged after the election.

\par We will be using SQLite to store our data, and use SQLite to manipulate the data to help compare the three diffrent major stock markets. We will use R to diplay diffrent types of graphs by using the data, to maybe help with the visulization. 

\par Our interface will be in javascript and html and css, for the user to move through with ease.
